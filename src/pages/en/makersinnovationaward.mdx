    **The Innovation Ecosystem of Ukraine is greatly affected by the war**, which has a massive negative effect on the Ukrainian society and its social cohesion. The determined maker movement, a vital part of Ukrainian society, strives to help the nation heal and grow.

    By fostering collaborations among people who team up for social impact this initiative promotes innovative solutions, emphasizing quality, impact, and coexistence over mere competition.

    **We invite makers:** tech enthusiasts, engineers, crafters, designers, and inventors to join hands in shaping a brighter future for Ukraine. The top eight project ideas will receive a prize of €50,000 each, accompanied by a personalized mentoring program tailored to the specific needs of each project.
