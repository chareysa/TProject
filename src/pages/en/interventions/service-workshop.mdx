TOLOCAR had a series of workshops in Sumy region. We had built and installed temporary polyethylene windows in Okhtyrka, Trostianets and Velyka Pysarivka

Temporary window — or plivkopaket — is made of plastic pipes, 4 layers of transparent polyethylene and an insulation noodle. One can install this window, instead of a ruined one, in approx 30 mins. It cost up to $15 and is durable for several months.

- 40 windows were built for the most vulnerable dwellers of the communities
- 30 more windows can be built with the materials, donated to the communities
- 3 workshops were held for the municipal workers, who fix the houses after the shelling

**They practiced assembling temporary windows with more layers of polyethylene, that creates air chambers and prevents warmth loses. We also owe to them the name of temporary windows ‘plivkopaket’, that means a camera made of polyethylene.**

You can find the scheme of the windows on Insulate Ukraine’s page.
