teaser: Making paper electrical circuits, and building aeorponic plant houses togehter with yound school children and teachers.

We are pleased to support school STEM education and return to Kyiv Gymnasium #315 with new workshops in May 2023.

During three days together with students and teachers, we built an aeroponic plant house. Now they will take care of the plants and use them for experiments in biology and chemistry classes.

During the assembling, children learned to work with a variety of Tolocar tools: a band saw, a laser machine, 3D printers, calipers and other.

We have also held a workshop for school teachers on how to make paper electrical circuits that they later can incorporate into their science and art classes for younger children, teaching them how electrical systems work or to create cool interactive art projects. They can use this knowledge to teach more than 600 children.

**Our goal was to show different scenarios of use and suggest open sources to find new ways of teaching. We are confident that these materials will help to make teaching more effective, and students will gain modern technological knowledge at school.**
