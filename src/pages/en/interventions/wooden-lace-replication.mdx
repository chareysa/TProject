Chernihiv Wooden Lace (NGO) is an initiative to preserve and replicate unique wooden architecture and its carved decor of Chernihiv region. Tolocar worked with the local team on a restoration project of a house on Muzeina 2B Street on April, 2-14.

The team of the [@demer.cn.ua](https://www.instagram.com/demer.cn.ua/) restored the facade with its ornamental carvings. Tolocar helped with the works and also scanned the precious decor elements, that are especially characterizing the local architecture.
The house itself is not a listed heritage building yet. Anyway, Tolocar is honored to work on a project to protect and replicate the Chernihiv cultural heritage and digitally archive it. And that way, to bring the local craftsmen’ masterpiece to the wider community.

Our impact: 
- 30+ lace volunteers
- 3 owners of wooden houses
- tourists and hundreds of passers-by on the street every day
