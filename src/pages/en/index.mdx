    The word "Toloka" stands for a traditional form of solidarity support in Ukraine. 
    With that in mind, the Tolocar project uses mobile makerspaces equipped with tools, open source hardware machines and consumables to support humanitarian activities in Ukraine.
    Various partners work together in different projects like **reconstruction & renovation, open production, knowledge transfer and innovation** to strenghten the eco-system of Ukraine.

            When faced with challenges or adversity way beyond what a person can handle - one of the cultural responses in Ukraine is "Toloka".

          This means **they bring the capacity of high end manufacturing or diagnosis technologies to the point of need.** 

          But crucially they remain plugged into a world wide community of diverse domain experts who can bring their collective intelligence to bear in ways that complement conventional relief or rebuilding efforts.
        </div>
        <div class="flex-1">
          The aim is to enable communities to replicate some of the capabilities and so to catalyze rebuilding efforts and establish support networks.  

          Beyond the technical capability this provides the Tolocars with the agility, diversity of perspective, and capacity to absorb feedback directly from the user's context. 

          All this enables highly reactive user centered designs, short feedback loops, and disintermediation, and adapting products and services to complex and changing environments.

          This community is generally highly networked and very effective in matching problems with persons able to contribute parts of a solution. This is particularly common in the highly collaborative open source hard- and software movements.

          These networked communities are sometimes able to frame a personal or general problem very differently and so avoid or solve it very resource efficiently. 

          Such user driven innovation can lead to highly specialized solutions that aren't reliably served by mass markets. However today some open source hardware competes with well established mass market products.
